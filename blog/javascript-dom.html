                    <h2>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>

                    <p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading
                        Style Sheets) are the building blocks for all websites.
                        HTML provides the structure for the content while CSS
                        the flow and styling. For context in the real world,
                        think about a sports arena.</p>
                    <p>The most basic sports arena would include a field/court,
                        stands for spectators and flood lights – this is HTML in
                        a nut shell. It provides the structure required to make
                        the arena possible. CSS adds the size and shape of the
                        field. Is it a rectangle for rugby or an oval for
                        cricket? The height of the grand stand, the colours of
                        the seating and how bright the lights are. </p>
                    <p>So where does JavaScript fit in? JavaScript has all the
                        bells and whistles which add to your experience. Turning
                        the flood lights on when it’s dark, playing music when
                        your team scores and sounding the horn to start the
                        game, just to name a few. </p>
                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language built for the web to
                        enhance your experience while using websites. JavaScript
                        interacts with both HTML and CSS by changing or adding
                        content and styles to a web page while a user interacts
                        with it.</p>

                    <h2>Control flow and loops, arrays and objects</h2>
                    <p> Control flow and loops provide decision making
                        capabilities for websites and applications. For example,
                        when you cross a road, you first check to see if its
                        safe. You look to your left and right. If it is safe,
                        you cross the road, otherwise, keep checking until it is
                        safe to cross.</p>
                    <p>Control Flow and loops work in the same way. Control flow
                        can be thought of as checking to see
                        if the road is clear. Loops can be thought of as, while
                        the road isn’t clear, you keep scanning the road until
                        you are happy to cross. Loops are effectively a
                        repetition of a task until a condition is met.</p>
                    <p>Arrays and objects can be thought of as boxes of
                        information. Arrays allow you to store lists of
                        information such as names on a guest list. Objects allow
                        you to tie pieces of information to one key identifier.
                        For example, listing all of the guests names and adding
                        values to them such as, RSVP, contact information and
                        food allergies. The benefit of this is that you can tie
                        many pieces of information to one key item, making it
                        easy to retrieve information as you only need to know
                        the guests name.</p>

                    <h2>Functions and why they are useful?</h2>
                    <p>Functions are declared segments of code which perform a
                        particular task. The function can called upon saving the
                        need to manually perform a task or write the code again.
                        For example, a digital watch adds every minute up to
                        sixty and on the sixtieth minute, adds an hour onto the
                        time. Your watch does this every hour and is repeated
                        over and over again.</p>

                    <h2>The DOM and Developer Tools </h2>
                    <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface for web
                        documents. It shows the page so that programs can change
                        the structure, style and content. The DOM represents the
                        document as nodes and objects allowing programming
                        languages to interact with it. </p>
                    <p>Web browsers such as Google Chrome, include a powerful
                        suite of developer tools. These tools appear in a
                        sub-window when prompted (right click on a web page and
                        select “inspect”) and allow developers to interact with
                        web pages. The tools allow manipulation of content and
                        styles but also provide important website performance
                        testing and data. Information such as load time, search
                        engine optimization ratings and a summary of the
                        different components allow developers to tweak their
                        websites, improve performance and deliver high quality
                        websites and applications.</p>
