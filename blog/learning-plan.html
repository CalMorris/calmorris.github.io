          <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
          <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

          <p>Work on long term projects that people get use of everyday but have
            a lot of variety in day to day work.</p>
          <p>Growth and challenge is very important to me. It’s easy when
            things become comfortable but it also gets stale quickly. </p>
          <p>Work/life balance is important to me. I have previously had jobs
            where I felt there wasn’t any balance.</p>

          <h2>Describe your strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
          <p>Strengths are: Persistent, hard working, attention to
            detail/perfectionist and curious.</p>
          <p>Weaknesses are: I become fixated when something doesn’t work or I
            don’t understand something.</p>

          <h2>What non-technical skills would you like to develop while at Dev
            Academy? </h2>
          <p>Become a better listener.</p>
          <p>Become more present in conversions.</p>

          <h2>How will you manage yourself to work productively?</h2>
          <p>Create and maintain a routine of starting at 8:30am each day.</p>
          <p>Begin each day by outlining goals and start with small tasks to
            build momentum.</p>
          <p>Take regular breaks and reflect on progress.</p>
          <p>Check in with peers and stay connected – will help keep me
            connected and motivated.</p>

          <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get
            to you?</h2>
          <p>Reflect on progress.</p>
          <p>Make sure that I understand the problem.</p>
          <p>Break the problem down into small bite sized chunks.</p>

          <h2>If I am stuck on a problem I will do the following:</h2>
          <p>Google solutions other people have used and understand why they
            worked.</p>
          <p>Read documentation to make sure I understand the methods I am
            trying to use.</p>
          <p>Reach out to cohort to see if anyone else has had a similar
            problem.</p>
          <p>Post the obstacle problem on stack overflow to ask help from the
            community.</p>

          <h2>Describe what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
          <p>Challenge my thinking and problem solving to become a better programmer.</p>
          <p>Provide guided learning when stuck on a problem.</p>
          <p>Honest feedback that helps my growth. Even if it's an inconvenient truth.</p>

          <h2>How will you schedule information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</h2>
          <p>Review week in advance and if there are any potential conflicts, look to compromise or discuss.</p>
