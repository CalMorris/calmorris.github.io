          <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
          <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li><p>My long term goal is to work as a full stack developer</p></li>
            <li><p>Work on long term projects that people get use of everyday
                but
                have
                a lot of variety in day to day work.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Growth and challenge is very important to me. It’s easy when
                things become comfortable but it also gets stale quickly.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Work/life balance is important to me. I have previously had
                jobs
                where I felt there wasn’t any balance.</p></li>
          </ul>

            <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>

              don’t understand something.</p>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><p>Learn to work with many people on a project (ie pair
                programming). I am used to working on projects alone and this
                would is a skill I need to develop.</p></li>

            <li>
              <p>Begin each day by outlining goals and start with small tasks to
                build momentum.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Take regular breaks and reflect on progress.</p>
