        <h1>Best Practices for Using Classes and ID's</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Before we delve into the best practices, let's first begin by
          discussing what a website is made of and the role ID's and classes
          play on a website.</p>
        <p>Websites are made up of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p>
        <p>HTML elements tell your web browser what information the website will
          contain. For example, a <span class='blog-code-example'>&lt;p&gt;</span>
          element defines a paragraph of text and an <span
            class='blog-code-example'>&lt;img&gt;</span> element defines an
          image. With this information the browser understands of how to treat
          each element and improve your experience of the website. </p>
        <p>CSS adds style to your website. It tells your web browser how to
          present the information to you. For example, what font to use, what
          colour the background is and how large images are.</p>
        <p>The HTML elements provide the structure to your website but their
          default styling is quite bland. Here is an example of a website with
          no styling:</p>
        <img class='blog-image-half' src="img/html-css-blog/html-css-1.png"
          alt="website example">
        <p>As you can see it is not very appealing and there is a lot of room
          for improvement. Now that we have some structure, we can begin adding
          our styling the web page.</p>
        <p>CSS Styles can be applied directly to elements, but the drawback with
          this approach is that we are limited in what can be selected. For
          example, there are 3 images of dogs and we want the second image to be
          round and with a black border. After adding a <span
            class="blog-code-example">border</span> and <span
            class="blog-code-example">border-radius</span> to the <span
            class='blog-code-example'>&lt;img&gt;</span> element, this is the
          result:</p>
        <img class='blog-image-half' src="img/html-css-blog/html-css-2.png"
          alt="website example">
        <p>This happens because all of the <span class='blog-code-example'>&lt;img&gt;</span>
          elements were selected and the browser applied the styling to all of
          the images. It is very common when building a website to have similar
          element such as <span class='blog-code-example'>&lt;div&gt;</span>'s
          where classes and ID's are very useful to transform the web page.</p>
        <h2>Classes and ID's</h2>
        <p>ID's and classes act as selectors on a website. Allowing the
          selection of specific elements and assigning attributes to them. This
          provides control over where styles are applied and how they are
          applied. Before you assign an ID or class to an element, it is
          important to understand the difference between the two selectors.</p>
        <p class='blog-code-example'><i>The ID selector allows you to define
            style rules that apply to a <strong>single</strong> element on the
            web page. </i></p>
        <p class='blog-code-example'><i>The class selector allows you to define
            style rules that apply to <strong>any element</strong> with a class
            attribute equal to a certain value.</i></p>

        <p>You can assign a class or ID to an element like this <span
            class='blog-code-example'>&lt;img class='class-name'&gt;</span> or
          <span class='blog-code-example'>&lt;img id=â€™id-name&gt;</span>.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of classes and an ID being assigned to three
          images. The first and third images are assigned a class to give them a
          black border. The second image has been assigned with an ID to make
          the image round along with a black border.</p>
        <img class='blog-image-half' src="img/html-css-blog/html-css-3.png"
          alt="website example">
        <p>This works as intended because the ID is assigned to one element and
          the class is assigned to multple.</p>

        <h2>Multiple ID selectors</h2>
        <p>The browser will apply multiple ID selectors if it has been supplied
          but it is best practice to use it with a single element. ID selectors
          have a higher hierarchy than classes and if they are both used on the
          same element, the ID will have priority. Below is an example of an ID
          with an attibute of <span class="blog-code-example">border-radius="50%"</span>
          being added to the first image as well as a class with an attribute of
          <span class="blog-code-example">border-radius="0%"</span>. Notice how
          the image is round. This is an example of why an ID should be used on
          a single element only and used with caution.
          Click <a href="https://codepen.io/calmorris/pen/rNwjWVB?editors=1100"
            target="_blank">here</a> to see an example in Codepen.</p>
        <img class='blog-image-half' src="img/html-css-blog/html-css-4.png"
          alt="website example">
        <p>While ID's and classes appear to function in a similar way, ID's have
          greater functionality. ID's are intended to be unique and as a result
          have added functionality. They can be used as anchor points on a page
          which can be hyperlinked to. A user can click on a element that has an
          ID as a target, which will direct the user to a specific location on
          the web page.</p>
        <p>In addition, JavaScript can access selectors and because ID's are
          designed for single use, expects to only find one element containing
          an ID it has been supplied. If the same ID has been added to multiple
          elements on a single web page, JavaScript will not behave as
          programmed and may cause bugs in your code.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>When designing a website, think about common trends in the design. If
          you notice a pattern in the elements being used and the style you're
          giving them, then it's a good idea to use classes. If you are creating
          something unique, then using an ID is a good choice.</p>
