                    <h2>Influence of Culture on Values and Identity</h2>

                    <p>
                        I was born and spent my youth in South Africa. At the
                        age of
                        thirteen my family immigrated to New Zealand for my
                        siblings
                        and I to have a better life and more opportunities. My
                        family are also of Dutch and British descent. A mixture
                        of
                        family culture and national culture has shaped me into
                        becoming the person I am today.
                    </p>
                    <p>The exposure has taught me to value work ethic and
                        adaptability.</p>
                    <p>Immigrating can be tough because everything that was once
                        familiar is now different, it requires you to change and
                        adapt. Lifestyle, food and relationships are all similar
                        but
                        different.</p>
                    <p>Seek to understand and not be understood, is something
                        that
                        has stuck with me along the way. Living in a new country
                        can
                        be uncomfortable and it’s easy to get caught up in how
                        things used to be done and resist change. Taking a
                        moment to
                        stop and understand another perspective has valuable
                        because
                        there is usually a reason why things are, the way they
                        are.</p>
                    <p>In summary, I value work ethic, adaptability, curiosity
                        and
                        understanding.</p>

                    <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses While Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        My strengths are that have a curious mind and hard
                        working. I am detail oriented and enjoy creating work
                        that is of good quality. I am hard working and
                        persevere when faced with a challenge.</p>
                    <p>
                        My weaknesses are; I can become fixated when things
                        aren’t working and as a
                        result don’t slow down and solve the problem with a
                        different perspective. I do better taking baby steps
                        while learning but get caught up in the moment at times
                        and want the outcome fast.
                        I have learn't during the course that I also dont spend
                        enough time reflecting and is something I am working on.

                    <h2>Overcoming Obstacles</h2>
                    <p>
                        In prior roles I have spent a bit of time completing
                        personality profiles such as the Myers Briggs
                        questionnaire and a few other similar isometric tests. I
                        found them quite accurate and helped me understand some
                        of my personal attributes which may help me overcome
                        learning obstacles.
                    </p>
                    <p>Perseverance is a quality which has helped me overcome
                        many obstacles before. The <span
                            class='blog-code-example'> ‘not yet’</span> attitude
                        covered in the prep curriculum is something that will
                        serve well with obstacles. Although perseverance is
                        helpful, I also need to acknowledge when something is
                        not working and change tact. Being mindful and
                        self-aware will be important when facing obstacles.</p>
                    <p>I am also curious and like to understand how things work.
                        Taking the time to learn and understand the obstacle
                        will be beneficial. While this is a strength, I need to
                        make sure I don’t get bogged down in details that aren’t
                        relevant for the obstacle I am facing.</p>

                    <h2>Ethical Decisions and Values</h2>
                    <p>I was working in Canada as a performance analyst and
                        coach. I
                        was coaching of a team playing in the Oceania 7's
                        rugby
                        competition. We were travelling with a player who 8
                        months
                        prior, sustained a concussion and was taking a long
                        time
                        to
                        recover. She had been doing really well in training
                        and
                        our
                        medical team decided that she was fit to travel to a
                        tournament with one condition. Prior to playing, she
                        needed
                        to complete test which involved a battery of contact
                        testing. If she completed the testing without
                        symptoms
                        during and after, she would be fit to play again.
                        This
                        is
                        something the player had looked forward to for a
                        very
                        long
                        time.</p>
                    <p>The player completed the tests without any symptoms
                        and
                        was
                        cleared to play. The morning of the tournament the
                        concussion symptoms returned and we were left to
                        make a
                        decision of whether she could play or not. We needed
                        to
                        decide if this was just a migraine or something
                        related
                        to
                        her previous concussion.</p>
                    <p>After lengthy discussions between medical and
                        coaching
                        staff,
                        we decided she could not play during the tournament.
                        We
                        had
                        her long term health in mind. The player was very
                        upset
                        because was looking forward to the tournament. Not
                        playing
                        meant that she was not eligible for up-coming
                        tournament
                        selections for Canada.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately our conservative approach was the right
                        decision
                        as her symptoms continued for a further week.
                        Allowing
                        her
                        to play could have some very serious consequences to
                        her
                        health.</p>
                    <p><strong>The values in this decision were:</strong></p>
                    <p>&bull; Health and wellbeing come first. Always have
                        the
                        best
                        intentions in mind, no matter how hard the path may
                        be.</p>


                    <p>&bull; Honesty and integrity is needed when faced
                        with
                        tough
                        decisions.
