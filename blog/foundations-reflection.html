                    <h3>What are three new things you have learned about
                        yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>
                                I can be stubborn about the way I want to solve
                                a problem and it’s good to change tact or take a
                                break and come back to it later.
                            </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                                I don’t take enough time to reflect on what I
                                have learn't after completing a project or
                                overcoming an obstacle.
                            </p></li>
                        <li><p>
                                Regular failure is important for growth.
                            </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness
                        in learning and programming?</h3>
                    <p>Empathy is very important to helping someone. To
                        better understand what they need help with, you need to
                        place yourself in their shoes to understand the problem
                        through a different lens. Self-awareness and
                        self-regulation is needed when helping someone to ensure
                        behaviour is appropriate. It is also essential
                        while completing my own work to ensure I don’t become
                        frustrated when faced with a bug or problem I can’t
                        solve.</p>
                    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                    <p>The value of making small things big through habits.
                        Taking regular breaks using the Pomodoro technique has
                        improved my ability to take on work with a clear
                        mindset.</p>
                    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core
                        learning?</h3>
                    <p>Understanding my values as it is not something I think
                        about often.</p>
                    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending
                        so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                        development bootcamp course?</h3>
                    <p>People are at the center of technology and it is an
                        important skill to work alongside many different people.
                        The better you work with people, the more enjoyable and
                        productive it is. </p>
                    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel
                        like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
                        time to practising programming instead? Justify your
                        answer.</h3>
                    <p>No, it has been enjoyable taking the time to think about
                        the non-technical aspects of programming and apply it
                        for better wellbeing and professional habits.</p>
