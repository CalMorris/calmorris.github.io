                    <h2>What is neuroplasticity and why does it matter?</h2>

                    <p>Neuroplasticity is the brains adaptation to internal
                        or external stimuli by re-organizing the structure and
                        functions of neural connections. This means that the
                        bonds between neurons where information is relayed,
                        become stronger and allow for better long term memory
                        and motor
                        function.</p>
                    <p>The term neuroplasticity or brain plasticity, was
                        defined because brain is malleable like plastic and can
                        transform, allowing the learning of new skills both
                        physical and mental.</p>
                    <p>Because our nervous system is malleable, it has allowed
                        us to learn physical skills such as; walking, running
                        and jumping. Mental skills such as knowledge of a
                        subject and self-awareness so we can adapt to our
                        environment. Our brains are always changing regardless
                        of age.</p>
                    <p>This is beneficial as it means a person can learn and
                        improve on skills through practice and visualisation.
                        Practice strengthens the bonds between neurons and
                        allows for better performance of a skill.</p>
                    <p>In addition, learning new skills alters the brain in
                        a way that transforms the neural networks. The more
                        often a person is learning new skills, the better they
                        become at learning because they have strengthened their
                        neural network and primed the brain to
                        learn new skills more readily.</p>

                    <h2>What can I do to benefit from neuroplasticity?</h2>
                    <p>&bull; Learn about new skills often to improve learning
                        ability.</p>
                    <p>&bull; Practice regularly to strengthen neural pathways.
                        The more you practice, the stronger connections become.</p>
                    <p>&bull; Put information in context. Information that is
                        shared in
                        a way where relationships are clear, will generate
                        greater
                        brain cell activity and will achieve more successful
                        long-term memory.</p>
                    <p>&bull; Set goals that are slightly above current
                        knowledge and capabilities.</p>

                    <h2>Growth Mindset: what is it & why is it relevant?</h2>

                        vs fixed mindset descriptions">
                    <p>One of the most basic beliefs we carry about ourselves,
                        are to do with our belief in our ability. </p>
                    <p>A “fixed mindset” assumes that our character,
                        intelligence, and creative ability are static which we
                        can’t change in any meaningful way, and success is the
                        affirmation of that inherent intelligence, an assessment
                        of how those measure up against an equally fixed
                        standard; striving for success and avoiding failure at
                        all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being
                        smart or skilled.</p>
                    <p>A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on
                        challenge and sees failure not as evidence of
                        unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for
                        growth and for stretching our existing abilities.</p>
                    <p>For example, a fixed mindset will view learning to
                        play the piano as a challenge and when faced with
                        possible failure, give up easily, avoiding the
                        challenge. This will feel like a pointless skill and
                        ignore and feedback that may be helpful to success.</p>
                    <p>A growth mindset will embrace the challenge and persist
                        when facing setbacks. Effort and feedback is part of the
                        path to mastery. The success of others is something that
                        can be learned from.</p>
                    <p>This is relevant to learning any skill because mindset
                        plays a large part in learning. If mistakes
                        are viewed as a negative consequence instead of a
                        learning opportunity, growth is much slower and the
                        probability of giving up is greater.</p>

                    <h3>Enabling a growth mindset at EDA</h3>
                    <p>After reviewing fixed vs growth mindsets, I now
                        recognize I have had a fixed mindset at times
                        and that has limited opportunities for myself. This is a
                        skill that needs to be worked on, especially when
                        learning becomes more challenging. The following
                        strategies are now incorperated into my learning plan
                        while attending EDA: </p>

                    <p>&bull; Embrace challenge and acknowledge failure is part
                        of the process and a learning opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p>&bull; Reflect regularly on the process and journal
                        lessons learned.</p>
                    <p>&bull; Read work of successful people.</p>
                    <p>&bull; Practice and place an emphisis on positive effort
                        while tasked with a challenge.</p>
