                    <p>Building applications that fit a purpose and enhance
                        people’s lives is extremely rewarding. It comes with a
                        sense of pride and achievement but it also comes with
                        overcoming obstacles. Computers require very direct and
                        accurate information in the programming process.
                        Mistakes in code are often not interpreted and this
                        leads to bugs or unintended outcomes in the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rather than muddling through the de-bugging process and
                        hoping to accidentally find a solution, there are a
                        range of techniques and tools which can be used to aid
                        the problem solving process.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
                    <p>Pseudocode is the first step. Before writing any code,
                        taking time to understand the problem you are trying to
                        solve and then writing down the steps needed to reach
                        the outcome. This approach is written in common everyday
                        language without technical syntax in the process.
                        Removing syntax allows you to think about the process
                        and prevent getting bogged down in what the syntax means
                        and how it works.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>There are many benefits to using pseudocode such
                            as;</strong>
                    </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Better readability.</strong> Easy to
                                understand steps for reaching the desired
                                outcome.
                                This can be shared with colleagues who can
                                assist in
                                the project without the need to ask questions as
                                the
                                work has been documented. Non-technical staff
                                can
                                review code and understand how it works without
                                the
                                need to learn a programming language.

                                prior to writing any code, you have a clear path
                                and
                                starting point.

                                discover bugs before actually writing a single
                                line

                    <h2>Console.log</h2>
                    <p>
                        Console.log is a function used to print results of an
                        argument to the console. The console is a is a tool that
                        logs information such as network requests, JavaScript,
                        CSS, HTML and security error’s to name a few. Using the
                        console.log() function in JavaScript, allows a developer
                        to print the results of variables and functions. This is
                        very useful in the build and debugging process. The
                        ability to print results provides the opportunity
                        investigate whether a task is performing as expected and
                        is often one of the first steps in de-bugging as it can
                        isolate part of the process.

                        Google is a developers best friend. Programming is a

                        all of the concepts, functions and use cases. Search
                        engines like Google provide access to resources such as
                        documentation which is regular maintained and community
                        forums such as Stack Overflow where developers can post
                        questions and seek help from other developers.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Rubber ducky debugging.</strong> Yes you read
                        that right. Rubber ducks have been helping programmers
                        solve problems for
                        decades. Before you pass judgement, it is worth
                        understanding what the rubber ducky method is and why it
                        works for developers around the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have all been there. The frustration that we feel
                        when code is not working or the output received is far
                        from what you want. This is normal and you might try a
                        range of solutions from; reading through your code line
                        by line for bugs, perform tests with console.log and
                        research for solutions on Google. What happens when all
                        of these attempts are fruitless? What can you do?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tell the duck your problem. Pretend the rubber ducky has
                        no coding experience and explain the problem that your
                        code is supposed to solve. Go into detail, and explain
                        your code line by line. At some point, you will tell the
                        duck what you are doing next and then realise why your
                        code is not working.

                    </p>
                    <h3>The Psychology Behind Rubber Duck Method</h3>
                    <p>
                        To write the perfect code, you need to be as specific as
                        you can because computers don’t understand vague
                        instructions. The majority of the bugs a programmer
                        faces in their code are caused due to the lack of
                        providing explicit information and instruction to the
                        software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While explaining a concept or a problem to someone (or
                        something), there are two subtle but ground-breaking
                        shifts in your brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first shift slows down your thinking. You’re able to
                        describe the details more precisely without missing out
                        on any information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second shift blends into the first one by the
                        assumption that you’re talking to a rubber duck that
                        understands nothing about the concept of coding bug.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By assuming that the duck doesn’t know details of the
                        problems as clearly as you do, you’re forced to churn
                        out the nitty-gritty bits and may find a solution in the
                        same shift. Often it is a silly mistake in the code that
                        was owed to speed and negligence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While practicing manipulating objects in the JavaScript
                        Kata exercises at Dev Academy, one task included
                        accessing an object which contained a list of students
                        and their grades. The task included adding a score to a
                        student. To perform this, the function needed to access
                        the object, the individual by name, the testScores
                        property and then the array of results.

                        To access properties in an object, the dot(“.”) and
                        square bracket (“[ ]”) notation can be applied. While
                        attempting to access the scores, I used the dot natation
                        and console.log'd it like this:
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-code-example">
                        function(gradebook, name, score) {<br>
                        &emsp; console.log(gradebook.name.testScores);<br>
                        }
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This returned an error:
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-code-example">
                        TypeError: Cannot read property 'testScores' of
                        undefined.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In response I copied and pasted the error message into
                        google and found no obvious answer’s. After that
                        approach did not work I began googling dot and bracket
                        notation for JavaScript and read articles on how it is
                        meant to be used. I found that dot notation cannot be
                        used to access an object with a variable because it is
                        not a property. So instead I used bracket notation on
                        the variable and then used console.log to test this.

                        This worked perfectly and I was able to complete the
                        challenge.
